Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?
  
  merge sort is stable because the order in which I compare two
  items is the exact same order in which i enqueue and/or dequeue
  the items. So if two items are the same, I check the first item
  then I check the second item, then I insert the first item followed
  by the second item. So the order is always preserved.

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not?

  Quicksort is also stable for the same reason as above. In the equals
  partition I insert items that are equal in order of precedence, that way
  when the equals partition is appended in the end, the order is preserved
  and Quicksort is stable.
