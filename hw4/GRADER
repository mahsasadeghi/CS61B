1. Our ADT is not as well protected as we would like. There are several ways by which a hostile (or stupid) application can corrupt our DList (i.e., make it violate an invariant) through method calls alone. Describe one.

One way an application can corrupt our DList is by calling a the next() method and passing in a null node, and assigning this return value to any x.next node. This would violate the invariant that for any x, x.next != null.}
